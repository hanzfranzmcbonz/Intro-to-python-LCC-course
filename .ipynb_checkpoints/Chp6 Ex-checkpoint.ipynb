It will be more work, but I guess it’s worth the extra practice. So, this question has multiple parts. first, I need to create a function that will create and write a series of numbers on a data sheet then closes the text file. Then I need a separate function what will then open that txt file and display the data. It seems counterproductive to make two separate functions to do this, so I’ll do some research to find out if I can do it all with one function."
